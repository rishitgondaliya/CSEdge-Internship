          Computer engineering is the fastest developing discipline in the
          world. It integrates several fields of electrical engineering and
          computer science required to develop computer hardware and software.
          Computer engineers embed computers in other machines and systems,
          build networks to transfer data and develop ways to make computers,
          faster, smaller and more capable. The major technical areas of
          Computer Engineering are : Cybersecurity, Networking, Database
          Handling, Artificial Intelligence, Design Automation, Computer
          software, Embedded Systems.
