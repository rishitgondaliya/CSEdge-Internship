              L.D. College of Engineering (LDCE) was established on 20th June,
              1948 as one of the first few engineering colleges in India. The
              institution owes its foundation to the bold and inspired vision of
              Kasturbhai Lalbhai, who named the college after his father,
              Lalbhai Dalpatbhai.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Initially affiliated to Bombay University, L.D. College of
              Engineering (LDCE) came under the Gujarat University after its
              establishment in 1949.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              land for the campus was donated by the Lalbhai family, who played
              a major role in decisions pertaining to this institute in its
              initial years. LDCE started its journey by offering three
              undergraduate courses in Mechanical, Civil and Electrical
              Engineering with an intake of 35 students in each field.
